# Extension Icons

Place your PromptWeaver logo/favicon files in this directory with the following names:

- `icon-16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon-32.png` (32x32 pixels) 
- `icon-48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon-128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can use your existing logo files from `/public/assets/` and resize them to these dimensions.

## Converting your existing logos:

1. Copy `logo-dark-theme.png` from `/public/assets/`
2. Resize to create the 4 required sizes
3. Name them as specified above
4. Place them in this `/extension/icons/` folder

The extension will use these icons in:
- Browser toolbar (16px, 32px)
- Extension management page (48px)
- Chrome Web Store (128px)
